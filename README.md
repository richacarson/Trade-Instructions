# IOWN Trade Instructions Dashboard

A shared, multi-user dashboard for the IOWN investment team to turn client-meeting
trade instructions into trackable tasks — with owners, status, multi-step
checklists, an activity log, and a staleness indicator that surfaces work that
has been sitting too long.

Built to prevent the failure mode where instructions are captured once, partially
executed, and then never re-read.

---

## Status

- **Phase 1 — Dashboard MVP:** built (this repo).
- **Phase 2 — Screenshot ingestion CLI:** not started. It will be added after
  Phase 1 is deployed and confirmed working.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Supabase project

1. Go to <https://supabase.com> and create a new project.
2. Note the project's **Project URL** and **anon public key** from
   **Project Settings → API**. You will also need the **service_role key** later
   for Phase 2 — do not put it in the web app.

### 2. Create the database schema

1. Open **SQL Editor** in the Supabase dashboard.
2. Paste the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` and run it.
   This creates all tables, indexes, triggers, Row Level Security policies, and
   adds the realtime tables to the `supabase_realtime` publication.

### 3. Seed the allowlist

Only emails in the `allowed_users` table can sign in.

1. **Edit `supabase/seed.sql` first** — replace every `lastname` placeholder with
   each teammate's real Microsoft 365 email. The email must match their Microsoft
   sign-in address exactly (matching is case-insensitive).
2. Paste the edited `seed.sql` into the SQL Editor and run it.

Add or remove people later:

```sql
insert into allowed_users (email) values ('first.last@paradiem.org')
  on conflict (email) do nothing;

delete from allowed_users where email = 'first.last@paradiem.org';
```

### 4. Configure Microsoft sign-in

The team uses Microsoft 365 accounts, so sign-in goes through Microsoft Entra ID
(Azure AD).

**In the Microsoft Entra admin center** (<https://entra.microsoft.com>):

1. Go to **Identity → Applications → App registrations → New registration**.
2. Name it `IOWN Trade Instructions`.
3. **Supported account types:** choose **Accounts in this organizational
   directory only (single tenant)** so only Paradiem accounts can sign in.
4. **Redirect URI:** platform **Web**, value
   `https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
5. Click **Register**. From the overview page, copy the
   **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID**.
6. Go to **Certificates & secrets → New client secret**, add one, and copy the
   secret's **Value** immediately (it is hidden after you leave the page).

**In the Supabase dashboard:**

1. **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Azure** → enable it.
2. **Application (Client) ID** — paste the client ID.
3. **Secret Value** — paste the client secret value.
4. **Azure Tenant URL** — `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your-tenant-id>`
   (restricts sign-in to the Paradiem tenant).
5. Save.

Then set the app URLs under **Authentication → URL Configuration**:

- **Site URL:** `https://richacarson.github.io/trade-instructions/`
- **Redirect URLs** — add both:
  - `https://richacarson.github.io/trade-instructions/**`
  - `http://localhost:5173/trade-instructions/**`

### 5. Local environment variables

```bash
cd web
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in `web/.env.local`:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-public-key>
```

`.env.local` is gitignored — never commit real credentials.

---

## Local development

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite serves the app at **http://localhost:5173/trade-instructions/**
(the `/trade-instructions/` path matches the GitHub Pages base path).

Other commands:

```bash
npm run build     # production build into web/dist
npm run preview   # preview the production build locally
```

---

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Deployment is automated by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### One-time configuration

1. **Repository Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:**
   select **GitHub Actions**.
2. **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository
   secret** — add:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

   (These are injected at build time. The anon key is safe to ship in a client
   bundle — Row Level Security protects the data.)

### Deploying

The workflow runs on every push to `main` (or manually via the **Actions** tab →
**Deploy to GitHub Pages** → **Run workflow**). Development happens on the
`claude/iown-trade-dashboard-WJK8B` branch — merge it into `main` to publish.

The live site will be:
**https://richacarson.github.io/trade-instructions/**

> If the repository name ever changes, update `base` in `web/vite.config.js`,
> the URLs in this README, and the Supabase Site URL / Redirect URLs to match.

## Using the dashboard

- **All Open** — every unfinished instruction across all clients, stalest first.
  Filter by owner or client. Each row shows how many days the item has been open.
- **Clients** — alphabetical client list with open-instruction counts.
- **Client detail** — that client's instructions grouped by status (Done is
  collapsed by default).
- **Instruction detail** — change status/owner, check off sub-steps, read the
  original message, post notes, and review the full activity timeline.
- **New** — create a client (or pick an existing one) and an instruction with
  multiple steps.

Updates appear for everyone in real time via Supabase Realtime — no refresh.

### Staleness indicator

Each instruction shows days open since it was created:

- **0–6 days** — neutral
- **7–13 days** — yellow
- **14+ days** — red

Completing a sub-step or editing an instruction bumps its "last activity", which
re-sorts it on the All Open view.

## Notes

- **Logo:** the Paradiem mark is currently a faithful in-app recreation
  (`web/src/components/Logo.jsx`). To use the exact official artwork, add the
  vector file and swap it into that component.
- **Phase 2 (planned):** a local Node.js CLI (`scripts/ingest-screenshot.js`)
  that reads a screenshot of a Teams message, parses it with the Anthropic API,
  and inserts the resulting instructions via the Supabase service role key.
